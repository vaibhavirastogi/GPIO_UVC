# GPIO_UVC

Hi! Here's the full UVM-based SV code of my GPIO UVC. It's a agent-based component that can help you drive and monitor sideband signal onto your DUT.
The special thing about this component is that it has been built to be extremely generic, and thus can be used with any project. User intervention is very limited and that too only to two files.

Here's the EDA playground link if that's easier: https://www.edaplayground.com/x/sfaw
